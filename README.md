# ContainerObserver

This is a sample impl of a [FabricObserver plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-observer/tree/master/SampleObserverPlugin) that monitors dockerd-process-hosted Service Fabric app container instances for CPU and Memory use. It is incomplete and requires testing. The purpose of this is to show how you could design and implement a FabricObserver plugin to monitor container resource use for containers that are hosted in a dockerd process in a Windows Service Fabric Cluster. Feel free to modify and submit a pull request if you get this working with changes (and fixes to the design/impl).
